-If login, set loggedIn state to 1
-Logout button (set loggedIn state to 0)

Form:
-Email validation (state for email and validation of email)
-Password validation (state for password and validation of password)

Log In:
-Set a logged in state in localstorage

Error modal:
-If email or password arent valid, render a modal indicating the type of error (not an email || invalid password)

After that...
-Header indicating possible elements accessible when user is loggedIn
